# Human Stress Analysis

This repository houses a project focused on human stress analysis, aiming to understand and quantify stress levels in individuals using various data sources and analytical techniques. The project leverages data from physiological signals, self-reported surveys, behavioral observations, or other relevant sources to infer and analyze stress levels.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project may consist of various types of data, including physiological signals such as heart rate variability (HRV), electrodermal activity (EDA), accelerometer data, self-reported surveys measuring stress levels, and contextual data such as time of day, activity level, or environmental factors. This multi-modal dataset allows for a comprehensive analysis of stress across different dimensions.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- **data:** Contains the dataset used for stress analysis.
- **notebooks:** Includes Jupyter notebooks detailing the data preprocessing steps, feature extraction, modeling, and evaluation.
- **src:** Contains the Python code for any custom data processing, feature engineering, or modeling techniques used in the project.
- **reports:** Contains reports generated from the stress analysis, including visualizations, summary statistics, and insights.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involves cleaning, filtering, and transforming raw data into a format suitable for analysis. For physiological signals, this may include noise removal, artifact detection, and feature extraction. Self-reported survey data may require encoding categorical variables and handling missing values. Contextual data may need to be normalized or standardized for consistency.

## Feature Extraction

Feature extraction involves deriving relevant features from the raw data that capture different aspects of stress. For physiological signals, features such as heart rate, skin conductance level, and activity level may be extracted. Self-reported survey data may yield features related to perceived stress levels, coping strategies, or symptom severity. Contextual features may include time-based features, location data, or social context.

## Modeling and Analysis

The stress analysis task involves building predictive models to estimate stress levels based on the extracted features. Various machine learning algorithms such as regression, classification, or clustering may be employed, depending on the nature of the analysis. Model evaluation is performed using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or correlation coefficients.
